/// # Usage
///
/// ## 1. prepare two arrays.
/// ```
/// let a = [["Francis", "Woodruff"]]
/// let b = [["Francis", "Woodruff", "Stanton"]]
/// ```
///
/// ## 2. make EditDistance
/// ```
/// let editDistance = EditDistance(from: a, to: b)
/// ```
///
/// ## calculates edit distance
/// ```
/// editDistance.calculate() [.add("Francis", [0, 0]), .delete("Francis", [0, 0]), .common("Woodruff", [0, 1]), .add("Stanton", [0, 2])]
/// ```
